## What is a Hub and Spoke map?
A hub and spoke map is a network design pattern that shows connections radiating from a central point (the hub) to multiple outer points (the spokes), resembling a bicycle wheel.
### Key Parts of the Map
* __The Hub__: A central node that serves as the main connection point for all activity. In our map this will be the stadium of the selected team.
* __The Spokes__: Individual routes or connections that link the hub to outlying destinations. In our map these will be the home country of the players on the selected team.
* __Limited Interconnection__: For other uses spokes generally don't connect directly to each otherâ€”traffic between them must pass through the hub. But, this is not applicable to our map.
