# PremierLeaguePrediction

View web app here https://premierleagueprediction-v6-wburt2025.streamlit.app

On this web app the following functionality is available to you.
- Predict a match between two teams
- See game week predictions vs. actuals and track the model accuracy
- Look up the schedule of a game week
- See the most recent table
- Review many difference data exploration plots
- Read about the data and the model
- Read a project write up

I try to update the web app every week after all the matches of that game week have been played.

I am also constantly evaluating the performance of the model and tuning it or adding refinements to the
comprehension of probabilities.
